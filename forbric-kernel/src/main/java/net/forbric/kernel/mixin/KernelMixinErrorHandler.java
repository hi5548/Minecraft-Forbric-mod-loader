/**
 * Puts a mixin that failed to prepare or apply on its owning mod's row.
 *
 * <p>Mixin's own report of an apply failure names a mixin class and a target and nothing about which mod; its
 * {@link IMixinErrorHandler} SPI hands over the {@link IMixinInfo}, so the config name is read off it and the
 * owner comes from {@link MixinConfigOwners} — no log text is parsed. The incoming action is returned UNCHANGED:
 * attribution never alters Mixin's decision, so a required config still errors and an optional one still warns.
 *
 * <p>Registered by {@link KernelMixinBootstrap} through {@code Mixins.registerErrorHandlerClass}, which is why
 * this has a public no-argument constructor and is named by {@link #NAME} as a string. Mixin instantiates it
 * through the service's class provider, i.e. the game loader, which delegates kernel packages to the parent.
 *
 * <p>The target class name is also handed to {@link HalfAppliedMixins}: Mixin has already merged the failing
 * mixin's methods into that class when an injector throws, and it reports the failure instead of undoing the
 * merge, so a member the throw caught half-rewritten is left in the bytes Mixin writes. See that class for the
 * measured case (balm's {@code FabricCropBlockMixin}) and what is neutralised.
 *
 * <p>Not covered: a raw {@code InjectionError} — an {@link Error}, not an {@code InvalidMixinException} — bypasses
 * every error handler, and Mixin then abandons the whole target class. An injector's OWN {@code require} (or
 * {@code allow}) produces one whatever the config says; {@link MixinLocalsCapture#softenRequirements} lowers those
 * on relaxed guest mixins, so it is reachable only under {@code -Dforbric.mixinDiagnostics} (requirements kept
 * strict on purpose), {@code -Dforbric.requireFailSoft=off}, or in a config the kernel does not relax.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.mixinErrorAttribution=off} skips the registration.
