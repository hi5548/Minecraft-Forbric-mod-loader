	 * and {@code .43-beta} deletes {@code PlayerInteractEvent$EntityInteractSpecific}, and the reference pack's

	 * {@code .57} and up are releases rather than betas, and the title screen brands whatever build it is running,
	 * so a beta carrier tells every player it is a beta; and JEI now declares {@code neoforge [26.2.0.67,)}, which
	 * {@code .38-beta} does not satisfy — staying put had become the thing that froze the pack.
	 *
	 * <p>Re-measured at the bump: {@code .38-beta → .88} removes 12 classes and adds 24; of the 98 jars in the
	 * reference pack exactly two named anything removed, and the current builds of those mods name none of it.
	 * Every {@code neoforge} versionRange declared in the pack is satisfied. The one thing only the class diff
	 * caught is that {@code client.gui.ModListScreen} moved to {@code client.gui.modlist} — which the kernel's
	 * mods-button redirect names, and which would have failed silently. {@code ForeignTypeCarrierTest} now checks
