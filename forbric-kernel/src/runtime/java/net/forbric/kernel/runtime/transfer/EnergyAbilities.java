 * What a bridged energy view knows about its store's direction. The bridge's {@link EnergyHandler} has no such
 * query; Forge's IEnergyStorage (canReceive/canExtract) and Reborn's EnergyStorage
 * (supportsInsertion/Extraction) do. A view that carries a Forge or Reborn store implements this, so the other two
 * APIs can answer with the store's own flags instead of a guess. The flags are hints for consumers; every insert and
 * extract is still the store's to refuse.
 *
 * <p>PORT(1.21.1): {@link EnergyHandler} is the bridge's own replacement for 26.2's
 * {@code neoforge.transfer.energy.EnergyHandler}; its shape and these rules are unchanged.
