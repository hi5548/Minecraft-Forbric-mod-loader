/**
 * Re-emits the SCREEN MOUSE events the byte merge left firing on NeoForge's hook alone.
 *
 * <p>Its own class, for the same reason {@link KernelGameClientTickEvents} and
 * {@link KernelGameRenderFrameEvents} are theirs: it names types in {@code net.neoforged.neoforge.client.event},
 * which a dedicated server must never be made to resolve. The kernel installs it only on the client.
 *
 * <h2>What is dead without it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Measured on {@code patched-mc-merged-26.2.jar}: of the 46 hooks {@code ForgeEventFactoryClient} declares,
 * EIGHT still have a call site (around {@code Camera}, {@code Gui} twice, {@code Screen},
 * {@code AbstractContainerScreen} twice, {@code ClientPacketListener} and {@code BlockStateDefinitions}). The
 * whole screen mouse family is in the other 38: the merged {@code MouseHandler} routes to NeoForge's
 * {@code ClientHooks} at every one of them — {@code onButton} at bci 316/345 (pressed) and 448/473 (released),
 * {@code handleAccumulatedMovement} at 247/288 (dragged), {@code onScroll} at 172/217 (scrolled) — and carries no
 * reference to {@code ForgeEventFactoryClient} in any of those methods.
 *
 * <p>So a traditional-Forge mod listening on {@code ScreenEvent.Mouse*} has a listener on a bus nobody posts to.
 * The render-frame bridge does not reach it: this is a different producer in a different class, and a mod can be
 * live on one and dead on the other. MouseTweaks is the whole mod: {@code yalter.mousetweaks.forge
 * .MouseTweaksForge} declares exactly four handlers — {@code ScreenEvent$MouseButtonPressed$Pre},
 * {@code ScreenEvent$MouseButtonReleased$Pre}, {@code ScreenEvent$MouseDragged$Pre} and
 * {@code ScreenEvent$MouseScrolled$Post} — and does nothing else. With these four dead the mod loads cleanly,
 * registers cleanly, reports nothing, and every one of its features is absent.
 *
 * <h2>Why two of the four do not go through the MinecraftForge hook</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code onScreenMouseScrollPost} and {@code onScreenMouseDragPre} are pure emitters — they build the event,
 * post it, and return — so the forward calls them, exactly as the other bridges in this package call theirs.
 *
 * <p>{@code onScreenMouseClicked} and {@code onScreenMouseReleased} are NOT. Each is a whole call site rather
 * than a hook: it posts {@code Pre}, and if nothing cancelled it calls {@code Screen.mouseClicked} /
 * {@code Screen.mouseReleased} itself, then posts {@code Post} and folds its {@code Result} into the answer.
 * Calling one of those from here would dispatch the click to the screen a SECOND time — the merged
 * {@code MouseHandler} has already done it — which is a double click for every click, invisible in any log and
 * far worse than the hole being fixed. So those two forwards post MinecraftForge's own {@code Pre} event
 * directly, the way {@link KernelGameBlockEvents#firePlace} posts MinecraftForge's place event rather than
 * calling a hook that would redo the work the merged base has already done.
 *
 * <p>Only the {@code Pre} half of those two pairs is bridged, because only the {@code Pre} half has a consumer:
 * their {@code Post} events carry a tri-state {@code Result} that overrides the click's outcome, and re-emitting
 * one without a mod asking for it would put a second authority on a decision the merged base has already made.
 *
 * <h2>Coordinates</h2>
 *
 * <p>PORT(1.21.1): 26.2's merged {@code MouseHandler.onButton} wrapped the click in a mouse-button event object that
 * both families' events carried; 1.21.1 has no such type, so the bridge hands each constructor the raw scaled
 * doubles and button both take. Nothing is converted across the bridge and nothing may be. Both families' events
 * carry GUI-SCALED mouse coordinates: the merged {@code MouseHandler.onButton} builds its event from
 * {@code getScaledXPos}/{@code getScaledYPos} and NeoForge's {@code ScreenEvent.MouseInput} stores exactly those,
 * while MinecraftForge's own dead call site was passed the same two numbers. Handing a mod raw window pixels
 * instead would leave it hit-testing the wrong slot — a bug that looks like the mod misbehaving rather than like a
 * bridge being wrong.
