/**
 * Both event families run BEFORE the one possible Mob.finalizeSpawn call. The caller supplies the same spawn tag
 * that created this entity. Forge's updated SpawnGroupData enters the one finalization call;
 * its returned data is discarded, as in both native BaseSpawner callers.
 *
 * <p>Native cancellation has two distinct meanings: cancelling the event skips initialization, while
 * setSpawnCancelled prevents the later world insertion. The previous adapter conflated these and posted Forge
 * only after NeoForge had already initialized the mob. Calling Neo's native hook with initialize=false posts
 * its event without initializing, leaving a single finalization point after both families have decided.
 *
 * <p>{@code PORT(1.21.1)}: 26.2's call site threads the entity's {@code ValueInput} through. 1.21.1 has no
 * {@code ValueInput} — its spawner loads entities from the spawn tag, a {@code CompoundTag} — and Forge's own
 * {@code onFinalizeSpawnSpawner} takes a {@code CompoundTag} here, so the tag is the carrier.
 * {@code SpawnerFinalizeInjector} proves that tag reaches the hook (the one {@code SpawnData.getEntityToSpawn()}
 * the caller handed to {@code EntityType.loadEntityRecursive}) and supplies it as the one extra trailing
 * argument; {@link #finalizeMobSpawnSpawner} without it is the native path for a call site that was never
 * routed.
