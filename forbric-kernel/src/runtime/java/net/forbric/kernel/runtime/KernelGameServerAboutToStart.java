/**
 * Re-emits NeoForge's server about-to-start on traditional MinecraftForge's, piece by piece.
 *
 * <p>MinecraftForge's own {@code handleServerAboutToStart} does three unrelated things in a row: it reads the
 * per-world SERVER configs its configuration-phase sync then pushes to joining clients, it applies Forge's biome
 * modifiers, and it posts its own {@code ServerAboutToStartEvent}. Nothing was calling it, so Forge mods' server
 * configs stayed at their defaults on both ends of every connection and no Forge mod ever received that event.
 *
 * <h2>Why the method is not forwarded whole</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because the middle step always throws here. The biome-modifier pass looks up a datapack registry
 * ({@code forge:biome_modifier}) that no baseline declares under the kernel, so forwarding the method as one
 * call would take the configs and the event down with it on every single start. Each piece gets its own guard,
 * and a Forge feature the kernel does not carry costs only itself.
 *
 * <p>The three log levels differ on purpose and are DATA, not inconsistency. Missing configs is a warning: Forge
 * mods silently keep their defaults here and on every client that joins. A missing event is a warning: mods
 * never learn the server is starting. The biome modifiers are DEBUG, because their absence is expected on this
 * kernel and a warning every boot would train the reader to skip the other two.
 *
 * <h2>What javac checks here, and what it cannot</h2>
 *
 * <p>Types, including {@code ConfigTracker.INSTANCE.loadConfigs(ModConfig.Type, Path)} and the typed
 * {@code MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.post(new ServerAboutToStartEvent(...))} — the shape-based {@code post} lookup
 * the boot side needed is gone, because the bus carries its own generic argument. ({@code PORT(1.21.1)}: 26.2's
 * Forge carries a per-event {@code BUS} field; 1.21.1's EventBus 6 has only {@code MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS},
 * and {@code ConfigTracker.loadConfigs} is an instance method reached through the public {@code INSTANCE}.)
 * One member stays reflective and cannot be
 * anything else: {@code javap -p} shows {@code getServerConfigPath} is {@code private static} on
 * {@code ServerLifecycleHooks}. Reimplementing it would mean reproducing MinecraftForge's own logic, which is
 * the one thing this project does not do. Forge's {@code runModifiers} is not called at all — see
 * {@link KernelForgeWorldgen} for where its modifiers run instead.
