/**
 * Re-emits the CANCELLABLE block events the byte merge left NeoForge-only.
 *
 * <h2>Breaking a block</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ServerPlayerGameMode} on the merged base calls {@code CommonHooks.fireBlockBreak} and branches on the
 * returned event's {@code isCanceled()}; it carries no {@code net/minecraftforge/} hook at all. So a
 * MinecraftForge mod's {@code BlockEvent.BreakEvent} listener never runs, and the cost is not cosmetic: claim and
 * protection mods do not protect, and block-logging mods record nothing. Both failures are silent — the mod loads,
 * its listener is registered, and the block simply breaks.
 *
 * <p>The forward POSTS MinecraftForge's own event rather than calling {@code ForgeHooks.onBlockBreakEvent}. That
 * hook re-does work the merged base has already done on the NeoForge path — the reach check, the block-entity
 * resync, the two packets it sends through {@code player.connection} when it denies — and running it here would
 * duplicate all of it, on top of requiring a {@code ServerPlayer} with a live connection, which the client-side
 * post from {@code MultiPlayerGameMode} does not have. Posting the event is what a mod is actually waiting for.
 *
 * <p>The event is seeded with {@code DENY} when the NeoForge event arrives already cancelled, because that is
 * what the flag means at this point: the game has decided against the break. A mod reading {@code getResult()}
 * rather than cancelling — MinecraftForge's own hook writes the result the same way — then sees the truth.
 *
 * <p><b>Known limit, stated rather than hidden:</b> {@code setExpToDrop} does not cross back. NeoForge's event has
 * no experience field for it to be written into, and the merged base takes the drop from its own path, so a
 * MinecraftForge mod that only adjusts the experience of a break is observed and ignored. Cancelling — the part
 * protection mods depend on — does cross.
 *
 * <h2>Clicking a block</h2>
 *
 * <p>Same class of hole in the same class: {@code ServerPlayerGameMode} posts NeoForge's
 * {@code PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickBlock} and {@code .LeftClickBlock} and nothing of MinecraftForge's. These
 * two carry more than a cancel flag — each has a {@code useBlock} and a {@code useItem} decision, spelled
 * {@code TriState} on the NeoForge side and {@code Result} on the MinecraftForge one — so the forward has to
 * translate rather than merely observe.
 *
 * <p>The write-back rule is the cancel rule generalised: a MinecraftForge mod's decision is taken when the
 * NeoForge side is still {@code DEFAULT}, and ignored when a NeoForge listener has already decided. So both
 * directions of a MinecraftForge decision cross — denying the block use AND forcing it — but neither overrules a
 * NeoForge mod that ran first, which is the same asymmetry cancellation already has and for the same reason: a
 * silent overrule is a far harder bug to find than a decision that did not apply.
