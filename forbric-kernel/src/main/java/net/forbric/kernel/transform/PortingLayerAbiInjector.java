/**
 * Adapts ForgeConfigAPIPort's compiled call sites to the NeoForge API it is actually running against.
 *
 * <p>{@link net.forbric.kernel.boot.PortingLayerAudit} is the general half of this problem: it reports, for any
 * Fabric mod that ships its own {@code net.neoforged.*} / {@code net.minecraftforge.*}, where its copy and the
 * carrier's disagree. This is the special half, and it is honestly special: a named ABI shim for one mod. There is
 * no general repair, because "the port's copy differs from the real one" has as many right answers as there are
 * differences, and guessing is how a config ends up written to two files.
 *
 * <p>The differences that matter:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ConfigTracker.registerConfig} takes a {@code ModContainer} on the carrier and a mod-ID
 *       {@code String} in the port's copy. Every call site is {@code getstatic ConfigTracker.INSTANCE} then
 *       {@code invokevirtual}, and each becomes an {@code invokestatic} into
 *       {@link net.forbric.kernel.runtime.KernelConfigPortBridge} with the tracker as argument zero — a
 *       one-instruction owner/opcode/descriptor swap, so no stack surgery, no frames, no {@code maxStack}
 *       change. The port does not keep one name for the class those sites live in; see
 *       {@link #CONFIG_REGISTRIES}.</li>
 *   <li>Its Forge-flavoured registrars return a {@code net.minecraftforge.fml.config.ModConfig}, read straight
 *       back out of the NeoForge config through the port's own {@code ModConfig.modConfig} field. The carrier's
 *       {@code ModConfig} is one class with no such field and no Forge half, so that read becomes the bridge's
 *       manufacture of a real MinecraftForge {@code ModConfig} — the other one-instruction swap here, and the
 *       only part of the bridge with a cost (the bridge's {@code forgeHandle} records it).</li>
 *   <li>Real {@code IConfigSpec} declares {@code validateSpec(ModConfig)}; the port's copy does not, and its
 *       {@code ForgeConfigSpecAdapter} implements the interface without it. The carrier's {@code registerConfig}
 *       calls it unconditionally, so the adapter gets an {@code AbstractMethodError}. Added here as a no-op,
 *       which is also what it means: the carrier's own implementation validates NeoForge {@code RestartType}
 *       against the config type, and a wrapped MinecraftForge {@code ForgeConfigSpec} has no such concept.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Drift is a refusal, not a warning.</b> If the port moves — a fifth call site, a renamed class, a
 * {@code validateSpec} it now declares itself, a {@code modConfig} read that has come loose from the call it
 * belonged to — the shim stands down whole rather than half-rewriting a jar it no longer understands, and the
 * audit's report stands on its own. {@code -Dforbric.portingLayerAbi=off} disables it.
 *
 * <p>Known limitation, stated rather than half-fixed: {@code /config showfile} stays broken. Its argument type is
 * built by {@code EnumArgument} over {@code ModConfig$Type}, and the carrier's enum implements
 * {@code StringRepresentable} nowhere, so parsing throws inside Minecraft's own lookup. Making the two
 * {@code getSerializedName} call sites resolve would leave that untouched and merely change the exception.
